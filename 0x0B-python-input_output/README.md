0x0B Python - Input/Output snake
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It's often used as a “scripting language” for web applications. This means that it can automate specific series of tasks, making it more efficient. This project covers input and output for manipulation of external files

At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:

How to open a file
How to write text in a file
How to read the full content of a file
How to read a file line by line
How to move the cursor in a file

What is and how to use the with statement
What is JSON
What is serialization
What is deserialization
