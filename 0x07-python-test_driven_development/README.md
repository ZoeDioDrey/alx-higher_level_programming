0x07 Python - Test-driven development üêç
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It's often used as a ‚Äúscripting language‚Äù for web applications. This means that it can automate specific series of tasks, making it more efficient. This project covers classes and objects! (The beginning for OOP an awesome programming paradigm)

At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:

What‚Äôs an interactive test
Why tests are important
How to write Docstrings to create tests
How to write documentation for each module and function
What are the basic option flags to create tests
How to find edge cases
