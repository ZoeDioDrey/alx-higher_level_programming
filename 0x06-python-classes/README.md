0x06 Python - Classes and Objects üêç
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It's often used as a ‚Äúscripting language‚Äù for web applications. This means that it can automate specific series of tasks, making it more efficient. This project covers classes and objects! (The beginning for OOP an awesome programming paradigm)

At the end of this project, I was able to understand and explain these questions:

What is OOP
‚Äúfirst-class everything‚Äù
What is a class

What is the difference between a class and an object or instance

What is self
What is a method
What is the special init method and how to use it
What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
What is a property
What is the difference between an attribute and a property in Python
What is the Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python
How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class
