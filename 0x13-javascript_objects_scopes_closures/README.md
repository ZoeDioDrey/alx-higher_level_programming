0x13 Javascript - Objects, Scopes and Closures üé¢
JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. This project covers programming objects as well as closures. OOP programming! :)

At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:

How to create an object in Javascript
What this means
What undefined means
Why the variable type and scope is important
What is a closure
What is a prototype
How to inherit an object from another
